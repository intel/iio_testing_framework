Usage

./test_script.sh -l log_level -e executable_path -r results_path_on_device -o output_path -d android_devices_identifiers -p devices_info -s tests_suite
./test_script.sh -l log_level -e executable_path -r results_path_on_device -o output_path -d android_devices_identifiers -p devices_info -s "cmdLine" -c command_line_test

log_levels:
	NOTHING	= 0,
	FATAL = 1,
	ERROR = 2,
	DEBUG = 3,
	VERBOSE	= 4

executable_path is path for iio testing framework executable
results_path_on_device is path for results in device
output_path is path for results in your system
File devices_info should contain on the first column an identifier for each android device and on the second column their serial numbers
android_devices_identifiers should defined between "" devices that are tested. If this option is not defined, all devices from devices_info are tested

Each sensor type is identified by one of the following tags:
	-accel
	-anglvel
	-magn
	-intensity
	-illuminance
	-temp

Tests syntax in tests_suite

test "test description"{
	command_1
	command_2
	...
	command_n
}

Example of commands:

list_triggers - list exposed triggers

list_sensors - list exposed sensors

clean_up - deactivate all sensors (doesn't fail if sensors are alredy deactivated)

activate_all_sensors/deactivate_all_sensors (fails if sensors are already activated/deactivated)

activate_deactivate_all_sensors counter counter_value - activate and deactivate all sensors for counter_value times (fails if sensors are already activated/deactivated)

activate sensor_tag_1 sensor_tag_2 ... sensor_tag_n (fails if sensors are already activated)

deactivate sensor_tag_1 sensor_tag_2 ... sensor_tag_n (fails if sensors are already deactivated)

check_channels sensor_tag_1 sensor_tag_2 ... sensor_tag_n - check if sensors have configured their channels

set_freq sensor_tag_1 freq frequency_value_1 sensor_tag_2 freq frequency_value_2 ... sensor_tag_n freq frequency_value_n - set frequency on freq_value for each sensor

check_freq sensor_tag_1 freq frequency_value_1 sensor_tag_2 freq frequency_value_2 ... sensor_tag_n freq frequency_value_n 
duration duration_value - check for duration = duration_value if samples frequency is close to set frequency

check_sample_timestamp_difference sensor_tag_1 freq frequency_value_1 sensor_tag_2 freq frequency_value_2 ... sensor_tag_n freq frequency_value_n delay delay_value duration duration_value - check for duration = duration_value if difference between every client delay and set delay is less than delay_value

check_sample_timestamp_average_difference sensor_tag_1 freq frequency_value_1 sensor_tag_2 freq frequency_value_2 ... sensor_tag_n freq frequency_value_n delay delay_value duration duration_value - check for duration = duration_value if difference between medium client delay and set delay is less than delay_value

check_client_delay sensor_tag_1 freq frequency_value_1 sensor_tag_2 freq frequency_value_2 ... sensor_tag_n freq frequency_value_n delay delay_value duration duration_value - check for duration = duration_value if each difference between system timestamp and client timestamp is less than delay_value

check_client_average_delay sensor_tag_1 freq frequency_value_1 sensor_tag_2 freq frequency_value_2 ... sensor_tag_n freq frequency_value_n delay delay_value duration duration_value - check for duration = duration_value if medium difference between system timestamp and client timestamp is less than delay_value

In test.txt are defined some examples of tests.
